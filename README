SimpleRLGolf:
  Implementing SimpleRL in as few bytes as possible!

Please, only Golf with languages that already exist in SimpleRL and if your 
chosen language isn't there, you can always fork SimpleRL, add it and send me a 
pull request, or email to nrkn.com@gmail.com and I'll add it for you.

Requirements:
  Must display the following map:
    ####  ####
    #  #  #  #
    #  ####  #
    #        #
    ##      ##
     #      #
     #      #
    ##      ##
    #        #
    #  ####  #
    #  #  #  #
    ####  ####
    
  Player starts at zero-based location {x: 2, y: 2}
  
  Map and player are drawn before the player provides any input
  
  Must provide a way for the user to move the player around the map, preferably
  the arrow keys
  
  Walls block the player
   
  In languages that don't have built in/portable IO feel free to include a 
  dependency such as curses, but document it in your readme so people can get 
  your code to work. Please use a common dependency, writing your own that is 
  deliberately very terse is against the spirit of the challenge

  End of file markers don't contribute towards size, using unicode chars which 
  are more than one byte do

  It is more important to follow these in spirit than in letter :)

Providing a pretty printed, commented version alongside your minified version
would be nice but not required

I'm going to kick this off with a C# version weighing in at 384 bytes
